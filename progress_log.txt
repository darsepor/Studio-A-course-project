off to a late start, setting up the repository and
some template classes for the game logic

Attempting to implement some basic GUI via ScalaFX.
Imported an older version of ScalaFX because I had issues with the newer ones.
At the moment of writing things are hardly functional.
I have this resource for hexes: https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/implementation.html
and also some calculations I got from ChatGPT. The latter works better so far but
it doesn't coincide well with game logic.
Managed to make a neat map using the resource above

Much work to do but I got the most important things down and it is just implementations left, for which
I have enough time.
